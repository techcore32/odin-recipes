        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p> There's nothing like a homemade frozen dessert after a long, hot, sunny day of cooking, playing, and possibly drinking outdoors.</p> 

            <p> The problem with many of these desserts is that you need an ice cream machine to make them, as well as you have to figure out how 
            to keep them frozen long enough to eat your fill of barbecued ribs and potato salad before you indulge.</p>   

            <p> Well, this beautiful, fruity, frozen treat requires no mechanical assistance, and stays frozen in a cooler for a long, long time.
            Even if it does thaw before you get to it, still makes for a wonderfully refreshing way to end your day.</p>

             <p>It's also relatively healthy compared to other similar desserts, especially if you layer your parfait with fresh fruit and granola.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>Yogurt</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine raspberries and ½ cup white sugar in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Crush with a potato masher into a puree.
                Cover and let sit out for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Pass berry puree through a fine mesh strainer to remove seeds. 
                Add blueberries, stir, and keep in the refrigerator until needed.</li>
            <li>Whisk yogurt, vanilla, lemon zest, and sugar for frozen yogurt together 
                in a bowl until sugar dissolves and the mixture is light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Transfer into a piping bag and refrigerate until needed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Parfait</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons of granola into an 8-ounce jar, or similar vessel. 
                Top with 2 tablespoons of the fruit mixture. </li>
            <li>Try to make sure some of the fruit sauce is touching the glass 
                so you can see the layers when frozen. 
                Top with 2 heaping tablespoons of the yogurt mixture.</li>
            <li>Repeat twice more for a total of 3 layers. 
                Top can be garnished with any remaining fruit and sauce.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Chef's Notes:</h2>

            <p>You can use crushed cookie crumbs, or crumbled up brownies or 
            cake instead of granola, if preferred.</p>
