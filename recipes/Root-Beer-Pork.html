        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>A slow cooker and simple recipe for your family reunion that can turn the most picky eater from hater to lover.</p> 
           
            <p>You can use a pork loin instead of pork shoulder if you desire. Even better, you could also combine it
                 with your favorite BBQ sauce and enjoy.</p>     
        

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
            <p><strong>Servings:</strong>10</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (4 pound) pork shoulder roast </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons coarse kosher salt, or to taste </li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle root beer </li>
            <li>1 (4 fluid ounce) bottle liquid smoke flavoring, or to taste</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Place pork roast in a slow cooker, rub with salt, and pour root beer, 
                liquid smoke, and garlic over the top.</li>
            <li>Cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours. Remove pork to a bowl. 
                Strain liquid through a fine-mesh strainer; 
                discard liquid or save for another use (see Editor's Note).</li>
            <li>Add garlic cloves back to to pork. Shred pork using two forks. 
                Serve with your favorite BBQ sauce.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Editor's Note:</h2>

            <p>To store leftover pulled pork, add a little of the reserved cooking liquid and store in the refrigerator.
               Reheat in cooking liquid to keep pork from drying out.</p>
