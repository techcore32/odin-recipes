            <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (26.5 ounce) can spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) jar banana ketchup</li>

            <li>1 pound hot dogs, sliced diagonally</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. 
                Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil.</li>
            <li>Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, 
                but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. </li>
            <li>Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
            <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; 
                cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the beef and pork; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until the meat has browned. </li>
            <li>Pour in the spaghetti sauce, banana ketchup, sugar, and water. Simmer until the sauce has thickened, 
                about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in hot dog slices and continue to cook until hot dogs are heated through.</li>
            <li>Serve over spaghetti with Cheddar cheese sprinkled on top.</li>
